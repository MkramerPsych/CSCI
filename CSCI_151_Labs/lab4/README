2) The worst case scenario is a grid of n rows and m columns, and the solver has a T of a constant C.
Therefore the Big-O complexity of the solver algorithm is O(m*n).

3) The stack appears to solve mazes at a faster rate than the queue. The stack solves mazes by exhausting each cardinal
direction from the start while the queue appears to test in an outward expanding pattern from the start square. Mazes where
the exit is directly to a cardinal direction from the start are solved much faster with the stack than the queue.
