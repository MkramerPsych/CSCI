With no reduction in percent of words found, the MRU list processes an equal number of 
words in a fraction of the time the doubly linked list takes.

The worst case of the contains method is not represented because the running time of the
contains method is O(n) in both cases.

For the doublylinkedlist, the doubling property appears to hold. For the MRU list, there is
only a marginal increase in worst case running time. This may be due to the rapid additions
to the front that distinguish MRU lists from standard doubly linked lists.

While the difference in speed between doubly linked list and MRU
lists remain constant, there is a proportional increase in elapsed time for both structures as the
lexicon grows, though the effect is much more pronounced on the doubly linked list.
This may be due once again to the front loading property of the MRU list giving it an advantage 
over the doubly linked list.
