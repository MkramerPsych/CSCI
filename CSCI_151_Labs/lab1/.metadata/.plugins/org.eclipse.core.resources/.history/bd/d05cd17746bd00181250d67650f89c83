/*Use a Scanner object to read from System.in which will capture keyboard input.  I recommend using 2 Scanners.  
 * The first is created to scan System.in.  With this Scanner you can use hasNextLine() and nextLine() to get an entire line of input from the user.  
 * Create a second Scanner to scan the input line and then use hasNextInt() and nextInt() to see if the user actually typed a number
 *  and then retrieve it. If the line doesn't start with a number (i.e., hasNextInt returns false) you should print a message out to the user 
 *  and loop back to where you read an entire line.
